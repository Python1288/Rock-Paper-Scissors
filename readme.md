ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

Simple game where a player select one of the three options and play against a computer.

Computer then randomly select either rock, paper or scissors, compare it to the Players choice and return
result of a round with total score as well. First one to reach 5 points wins the game, then website
asks user if he wants to play again.

What I've learned:
- improved understanding of JS functions 
- basic DOM
- basic css
